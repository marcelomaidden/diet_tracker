<p align="center">Diet tracking app is a full stack project, which includes manipulating dynamically the Virtual DOM and, use States and Props (useState Hook) and useEffect Hook to change the information accordingly with the user interactions. All data are retrieved from the Rails backend API and the information kept on a Redux store available on all application components. To secure the backend API, I use Doorkeeper. In order to test the React Components, I use Jest and React Testing Library. The Rails API is tested using RSpec. Built with React, JavaScript, Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Redux and Prop-types.</p>

## Generate Doorkeeper application client_id and client_secret
- Enter the command `rails c` in your terminal
- Type `Doorkeeper::Application.create(name: "Diet tracking app", redirect_uri: "", scopes: "")`
- Copy uid and secret generated after typing the command above
- In development environment add the environment variables in config/initializer/webpack/development.js like so:
`process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID = "uid generated above"`
`process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET = "secret generated above"`

To make any change,

- Open related file by using text editor.

## Usage
  - Run `rails s` on your terminal to open the server automatically on your browser
  - If it doesn't open automatically go to your browser and type the url `http://localhost:3000`

## Test if the API is working
- Got to `http://localhost:3000/sign-up`
- Create an user
- In your terminal type the command
`curl -X POST -d "email=your_user_email" -d "password=your_user_password" -d "grant_type=password" -d "client_id=uid" -d "client_secret=secret" http://localhost:3000/oauth/token`
- Change `your_user_email` and `your_user_password` to your user information
- Change `uid` and `secret` for the ones generated by Doorkeeper

## Test
  - Run `npm run test` to perform unit tests, also tests if React components are being correctly rendered;
  - Run `rspec --format doc` to perform test on the Rails API
